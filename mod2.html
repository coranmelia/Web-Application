<h1>HTML & CSS: Module 2</h1>

<div id = "container">
  	<section class = "s12 m6 l4">               
      <section id = "p1"> 
      <h2 style="background: #FFEBD6">Section 1 </h2>     
        <p>Layout: In the desktop view (992px and above), each of the 3 sections should take up equal amount of space on the screen. As you make the browser window wider or narrower, each section should become wider or narrower. (Hint: use percentages to define width and use the 'float' property. See Lecture 24). For a visual reference of this view, see the desktop mockup illustration below.</p>
      </section>

    <section class = "s12 m6 l4">

        <h2 style="background: #C6EDEF;">Section 2 </h2>     
          <p>Layout: In the tablet view (between 768px and 991px, inclusively), the first 2 sections should be in the first row and be of equal size. The 3rd section should be in the second row and take up the entire row by itself. For a visual reference of this view, see the tablet mockup illustration below.</p>
