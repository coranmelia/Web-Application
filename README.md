### Web Applicaton: Personal Website 

This site is still under development and expect to finish everything in Sep. 2019. 

Four main web pages are presented in this packet: homepage, gallery, portfolio, resume 

Pages implemented with Bootstrap and JQuery, loaded with with Ajax.

This web app is remodeled from my old project where data were served on MySQL. Since my website does not have tons of data I've taken down the backend.
